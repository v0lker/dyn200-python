	./dump_readings [--help]

plot graph and dump to file:
	click shortcut on desktop or application menu entry 'run motor test' in category 'other'
or
	make run-ui
or
	./torque_ui [--help]



IT DOESN'T CONNECT ("communication error") ====================================

make sure the sensor is powered on

make sure the correct communication parameters are set:
* 14400 baud
* 8N1
* communication mode 1
